## 🛠️ Why I Built This
- This is the group project for the Data Structure course. We choose this topic because it is the most relevant.
- It is also a good opportunity to learn JS and practice using those data structures in algorithms.
- I think after I finish this project, I will learn a lot. It will benefit me in future web projects.

## 🧩 Features
- 🚀 Interactive Visualizations – Dynamic and intuitive demonstrations of data structures and algorithms built with p5.js.
- 📂 Modular Architecture – Organized into four main sections: Basic Structures, Searching, Sorting, and Trees, ensuring clear separation of concepts.
- ✋ Hands-On Operations – Users can directly perform actions such as push/pop or enqueue/dequeue to observe structural changes in real time.
- 🎞️ Step-By-Step Algorithm Animations – Searching and sorting algorithms are visualized frame-by-frame to reveal internal processes.
- 🧼 Clean and Minimal Interface – A simple and accessible UI design allows each topic to be explored independently with minimal distraction.
