## 🛠️ Why I Built This
- This is the group project for the Data Structure course. We choose this topic because it is the most relevant.
- It is also a good opportunity to learn JS and practice using those data structures in algorithms.
- I think after I finish this project, I will learn a lot. It will benefit me in future web projects.

## 🧩 Features
- Interactive Visualizations – Each data structure and algorithm is demonstrated with clear, animated graphics using p5.js.
- Modular Pages – The website is organized into four main categories: basic structures, searching, sorting, and trees.
- Hands-On Demonstrations – Users can interact with operations such as enqueue/dequeue, push/pop, or watch step-by-step sorting animations.
- Algorithm Step Animation – Sorting and searching algorithms display each step in motion to show what happens behind the scenes.
- Clean and Simple UI – Designed with separate pages and clear navigation, making each concept easy to explore independently.
- GitHub Pages Deployment – Fully accessible online with no installation required.
